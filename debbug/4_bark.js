//Corrected code
function Dog(name) {

}
let fido = new Dog('fido')
fido.bark()


/*
https://github.com/bcherny/frontend-interview-questions/blob/master/debugging/bark.md
When you new a function in JavaScript, it creates a new object whose methods are inherited from the prototype of the function you new'd. This is called prototypal inheritance. Defining something on the prototype vs. on the function directly is analogous to defining something as an instance property vs. as a static property on a class.

This code incorrectly defined bark directly on Dog. So when you new a Dog, the resulting object won't inherit the bark property. For it to inherit bark, we need to move bark to Dog's prototype.
