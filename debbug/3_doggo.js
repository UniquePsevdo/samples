//Original code
/*
let dog = {
    name: 'doggo',
    sayName() {
        console.log(this.name)
    }

let sayName = dog.sayName

//Corrected code
let dog = {
    name: 'doggo',
    sayName() {
        console.log(this.name)
    }
}
let sayName = dog.sayName.bind(dog)
sayName()

In JavaScript this is dynamically scoped, which means this inside a function is defined based on the way you call that function. Unless you explicitly bind this using the call, apply, or bind functions, this is generally set to the thing that's to the left of the dot when you call your function.

When the code calls sayName() there's nothing to the left of the dot, so this is set to its default value: undefined if we're in strict mode, or the global object otherwise. But for this.name to be defined, this has to point to dog. There are a few ways we could do that:

    Explicitly bind dog to this using the bind function when we define sayName.
    Explicitly bind dog to this using the call function when we call sayName.
    Explicitly bind dog to this using the apply function when we call sayName.
    I chose option (1) because sayName can only be called when this is set to dog, otherwise the code will not give the correct result. I didn't want to leave it up to the consumer to do that correctly, so I used bind to make sure this will always be set correctly when calling sayName().*/
